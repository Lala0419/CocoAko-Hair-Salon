## About The website

This website is for a family owned hair salon located in Tokyo Japan. 

## How It's Made:

This project was for my first paid client with whom I was very fortunate to work. We had lots of conversations so I can understand what the client wants.
It has 4 landing pages (and styling files for each page) and I made this all from scratch in order to accomplish her needs. 
In the beginning, when I started working on this project, I hadn't learned about flex-box. So there are some parts that are styled with floats. (I later came back to this and added flex-box as well (it was so much easier!!)).
## Tech Used:
HTML, CSS



## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to use float, flex-box and media queries to make the website responsive to different sizes of devices. 
Since this was for my client, I also learned how to create a contract and proposal as well as to manage my time. 
It was a very good practice to get myself comfortable with working under some pressure. - such as completing tasks before our next meetings and due dates.
